			<p>CYBER SECURITY is a truly interdisciplinary field of study that is driven by complex, real-world challenges. Because of its historical associations, the field tends to be annexed as a technological concern. Increasingly governments and organisations are recognising that cyber-security risk is socially and politically constructed, a significant challenge for all aspects of governance. </p>
			
			<p><em>INTER</em>ACTOR is designed to capture data from workshops where physical models represent perspectives upon cyber-security resilience and risk. These models are rich social and spatial pictures constructed by those working in the midst of these real-world problems.</p>
